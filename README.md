This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) this semester. 

Term: Spring 2017

+ Projec title: What did the Presidents say at their inauguration?
+ This project is conducted by [Hongyi Zhu]

+ Project summary: In this project, I attempt to find interesting patterns and trends in Presidential Inauguration speeches by frequency analysis using the tools of text mining.

+ I have deleted some unnecessary files in this repository, and I have modified this read me file as of 2/4/2017.
+ Please note, the main project file is "project1markdown.rmd" in the DOC folder, which I have not touched since the due date of the project.
